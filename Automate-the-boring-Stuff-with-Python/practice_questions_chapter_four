1. What is []?
   The value [] is an empty list that contains no values.

2. How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored in a variable named spam?
   (Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10])
   spam[2] = 'hello'

For the following three questions, let's say spam contains the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

3. What does spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)] evaluate to?
   'd'

4. What does spam[-1] evaluate to?
   'd'

5. What does spam[:2] evaluate to?
   ['a', 'b']

For the following three questions, let's say bacon contains the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True]

6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?
   1

7. What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?
   [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?
   [3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99]

9. What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?
   + and *

10. What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?
    The append() method call adds the argument to the end of the list.
    The insert() method con insert a value at any index in the list.

11. What are two ways to remove values from a list?
    remove() when you konw the value; del when you know the the index of the value
    you want to remove

12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.
    Both lists and strings can be passed to len(), have indexes ans slices, be used in for loops,
    be concatenated or replicated, and be used with the in and not in operators.

13. What is the difference between lists and tuples?
    Tuples are immutable. They cannot have their values modified, appended, or removed.

14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?
    (42, )

15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list form of a
    tuple value?
    tuple([...]); list((...))

16. Variables that "contain" list values don't actually contain lists directly.
    What do they contain instead?
    They contain references to list values.

17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
    The copy.copy() function will do a shallow copy of a list, while the
    copy.deepcopy() function will do a deep copy of a list. That is, only
    copy.deepcopy() will duplicate any lists inside the list.
