1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
True False

2. What are the three Boolean operators?
and, or, not

3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).
True + True = True
True + False = False
False + True = False
False + False = False

4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?
1.False
2.False
3.True
4.False
5.False
6.True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
!=, ==, <, >, <=, >=

6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
The equal to operator compares two values and evaluates to a Boolean. The assignment operator stores a value in a variable.

7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
A condition is an expression that evaluates to Boolean value. It is used in Flow Control statements.

8. Identify the three blocks in this code:
print('bacon')
print('ham')
Everything inside the if-statement

10. What can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?
With CTRL+C you can stop a program that is stuck in an infinite loop.

11. What is the difference between break and continue?
When the program execution reaches an continue statement, the program execution immediatly jumps back to the start of the loop and reevaluates the loop's condition. If the execution reaches a break statement it immediatly exits the while loop's clause.

12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0,10) and range(0, 10, 2) in a for loop?
There is no difference. 

13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
for i in range(1, 11):
	print(i)

number = 1
while number < 11:
	print(number)
	number = number + 1

14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
spam.bacon()
